            <p style="font-size:30px;">After more than two years of restrictions, many travellers have amassed additional disposable income and want to invest it wisely. Indian hotels have reported a 187% increase in gross operating profit per available room (or GOPPAR) when comparing March 2022 with the same month in 2021, and hotel chains such as Marriott and Wyndham are expanding further in the Indian region, so it’s clear that this appetite for the ultimate in comfort and amazing experiences continues to grow in these two crucial markets. 5-star hotel bookings in the country have also seen a 5.4% increase between the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, jumping to almost 18% this year.</p>
